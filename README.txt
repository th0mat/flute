MagicFlute Installation

1. Install MagicFlute by double-clicking on installMagicFlute.
2. Go to the Applications folder and find MagicFlute.
3. Right-click MagicFlute and select OPEN.
4. Accept the message about 'unidentified developer'.

That's it. Step 2, 3 and 4 are only required the first time.
After that MagicFlute can be started like any other application.

After the installation the downloaded zip file and the folder it created
can be deleted.

WHAT THE INSTALLER DOES

The installer goes through the following steps

1. It copies the MagicFlute app into the app folder.
2. It enables wifi-capture by changing the permission of the included logging program.
3. It creates a directory at ~/Library/MagicFlute to store data and settings.
4. It does not overwrite existing traffic data and config settings.

During the installation you will be asked for the admin password. Unfortunately this
is required by the operating system to enable wifi monitoring. The good news is,
that this is only required during the installation.

HOW TO UNINSTALL MagicFlute

1. delete MagicFlute in the app folder (application)
2. delete ~/Library/MagicFlute (data and config settings)

done :-)
