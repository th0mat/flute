=================================

RIGHT-clicking is necessary. DOUBLE-clicking will not work
because PacketMozart is in Apple's terms an 'unidentified developer'.

WHAT THE INSTALLER DOES

The installer goes through the following steps

1. It copies the MagicFlute app into the app folder.
2. It enables wifi-capture by changing the permission of the included logging program.
3. It creates a directory at ~/Library/MagicFlute to store data and settings.
4. It does not overwrite existing traffic data and config settings.

During the installation you are asked for the admin password. Unfortunately this
is required by the operating system to enable wifi monitoring. The good news is,
that this is only required during the installation.

If you want to build MagicFlute yourself you find the source code on
GitHub (https://github.com/th0mat/flute).

HOW TO UNINSTALL MagicFlute

1. delete MagicFlute in the app folder (application)
2. delete ~/Library/MagicFlute (data and config settings)

done :-)
